[Am]If I had a g[G]un for every a[C]ce I have d[D]rawn,
[C]I could arm a [Em]town the size of [Am]Abilene
[Am]Don't you push me [C]bab[G]y â€˜[Em]cause I'm moanin' [D]low
and you [C]know I'm [C/B]only [Am]in it [G]for the [Am]gold

All that I am asking for is ten gold dollars
And I could pay you back with one good hand
You can look around about the wide world over
And you'll never find another honest man.

[G]Last fair [D]deal in the [A]country, Sweet Suzie
[G]Last fair [D]deal in the [A]town
[G]Put your gold [D]money where your [A]love is baby,
Be[C]fore you [C/B]let my [Am]deal [G]go d[D]own,    go [Am]down.

Don't you push me baby, cause I'm moanin' low
Well I know a little something you won't ever know
Don't you touch hard liquor, just a cup of cold coffee
I'm gonna get up in the morning and go

Everybody prayin' and drinkin' that wine
I can tell the Queen of Diamonds by the way she shines
Come to daddy on the inside straight,
Well I got no chance of losin' this time
