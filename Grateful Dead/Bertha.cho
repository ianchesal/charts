{c: Verse}
I had a [C]hard run,
Runnin' from your [G]window.  [C] [G]  [C] [G]  [C] [G]
I was all night [C]running, running,
Lord I wonder if you [G]care,  [C] [G]  [C] [G]  [C] [G]
I had a [C]run in,
Run around, and [G]run down.  [C] [G]  [C] [G]  [C] [G]
Run around the [C]corner, corner,
Lord run smack into a [G]tree.  [C] [G]  [C] [G]  [C] [G]

Dressed myself in green,
I went down unto the sea.
Try to see what's goin' down,
Try to read between the lines.
I had a feelin' I was fallin', fallin', fallin',
I turned around to see,
Heard a voice al callin',
Lord you was commin' after me.

I had to move, really had to move,
That's why if you please, I am on my bended knees,
Bertha don't you come around here anymore.

Ran into a rainstorm,
I ducked back into a bar door.
It's all night pourin', pourin', pourin',
Lord but not a drop on me.
Test me, test me, Test me, test me, test me,
Why don't you arrest me?
Throw me in to the jailhouse,
Lord until the sun goes down, ('till it goes down.)

I had to move, really had to move,
That's why if you please, I am on my bended knees,
Bertha don't you come around here anymore.
