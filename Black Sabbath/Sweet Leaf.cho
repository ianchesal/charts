When I first met you,
Didn't re-a-lize
I can't forget you,
For your surprise
You introduced me,
To my mind
And left me wanting,
You and your kind

[A]   [G]   [C]   [E]  [A]

I love you!
Oh you know it.

My life was empty forever on a down
Until you took me, showed me around
My life is free now, my life is clear
I love you sweet leaf, though you can't hear

Jam over a C# for about 8 measures

[C#]    [A]   [G]   [*x4]

Come on now!
Try it out!

Straight people don't know, what you're about
They put you down and shut you out
You gave to me a new belief
And soon the world will love you sweet leaf
