[G]Dear Mr. Fantasy [F]play us a tune,
[C]Something to make us all [G]happy.

Do anything to keep us out of this gloom
Sing a song, play guitar, make it snappy.

You are the one who makes us all glad
But doing that, you break down in tears

Please don't be sad if it was a straight life you had
We wouldn't have known you all these years.
